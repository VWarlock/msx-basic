# MSX BASIC Personal Repository

All code in this repository was recovered from *very old* K7 tapes using a
Gradient Expert 1.0 MSX with the Gradiente DR-1 Datacorder.

Some code has some glitches because of the bad condition of the tapes.
Eventually I'll make fixes in them.

All files contains code written in MSX-BASIC and are organized in 3
directories:

* **my:** Contains the original code written by myself.
* **books:** Contains software listed on MSX books with some "personal
  improvements".
* **3rd:** This directory contains 3rd-party software from diferent sources.
